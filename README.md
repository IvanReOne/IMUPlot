# IMUPlot
Android App for Real Time Pedestrian Deadreckoning


The Android app IMUPlot is an app that generates a live trace of a person walking with the phone in hand. The user needs to specify the starting coordinates (denoted by the red dots).
The app currently overlays the trace on the floor plan of CIC 2nd floor. For purposes of calibrating the heading the user is required to walk the first five steps in the same direction (every time the app is used).

The app was developed and tested on a Google Pixel smartphone.
